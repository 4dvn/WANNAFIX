# WANNAFIX

WANNAFIX is a mitigation script for the WANNACRY Ransomware that has been spreading lately.
It has a series of options which allow you to decide how you want to mitigate the threat while applying the appropriate patch.

<strong>Please note that this script should be treated as a temporary fix and should not be treated as a permanent fix!</strong>

# OPTIONS

WANNAFIX allows you to automate the following tasks:

1) Enable or disable SMB!
2) Add or remove the kill switch domains to your host file!
3) Spawn or kill the MUTEX which prevents WANNACRY from starting!

<strong>Note that the author of this script is not responsible for any damage caused, you automatically accept this when you run the script!</strong>

P.S this script must be run under an administrator user to operate correctly depending on the environment that you're attempting to execute it in.
