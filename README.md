# WANNAFIX

WANNAFIX is a mitigation script for the Wannacry Ransomware that has been spreading lately.
It has a series of options which allow you to decide how you want to mitigate the threat while applying the appropriate patches.
Please note that it should be treated as a temporary fix and should not be treated as a permanent fix.

# OPTIONS

WANNAFIX allows you to carry out the following tasks:

1) Add the kill switch domains to your host file
2) Disable SMB
3) Spawn a MUTEX which prevents Wannacry from starting

If you have already carried out some of the above tasks, the script will give you the option of enabling/disabling.

Please note that the author of this script is not responsible for any damages caused if the script malfunctions, you automatically accept this term when you run the script.
